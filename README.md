# Setting up

## PowerShell Core

1. Install PowerShell Core:

https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell

2. Clone this project to the PowerShell profile directory

Note: If you already have files there that you want to use, this can be cloned into a sub folder and then Modules can be linked.. but that is outside the scope of this README

Otherwise, you can clone directly to the folder

Locations:

Windows:

\%userprofile%\Documents\PowerShell\

Linux:

./config/powershell
